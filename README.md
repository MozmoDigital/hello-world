# hello-world
Repository for hello world intro guide

I hear the mention of Github all over the internet, from web developer blogs to in depth guides, but I've never had to use it for myself. Today (Friday 15th of March 2019) I will be making my first Github hello world project for Mozmo Creative. After this project, I will look at another guide on how to use github for a Wordpress website. Hopefully Github lives up to the hype.
